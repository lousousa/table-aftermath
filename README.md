## Overview

I developed this application inspired by a real-life scenario where I had to split a bar bill among several people, taking into account the different items ordered by each individual. The app operates by receiving a detailed list of items paid for by each person, presented in a user-friendly matrix of checkboxes. It then displays the proportional division of the total bill. Additionally, it offers optional functionalities, such as adding a 10% surcharge to the total and providing a feature to copy both the calculated results and the itemized list to the clipboard in a straightforward, plain text format.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn install
```

```bash
yarn dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## That's it

I initially created this tool for my personal convenience, aiming to streamline the process of calculating and splitting bills at bars and restaurants. However, I welcome anyone to fork this project and tailor it to their specific requirements â€“ or even use it as is, if it suits your needs! I hope you find it as enjoyable and useful as I do.
