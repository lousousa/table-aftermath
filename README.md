## Overview

I designed this app after a real situation I need to divide a bar bill amount between the people there, considering there were different items for each people. The app works by getting as input the list of the items which is paid for each person, visually organized as a matrix of checkboxes, then showing as output the current division of the total amount. It also provides some optional features, such as including 10% to the calculation and copying to the clipboard, as plain text, info like results and items list.

## Preview

Note: Since this version was intended to be **eventually** used by a (Brazilian) friend of mine, I kept its language PT-BR and its currency BRL.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn install
```

```bash
yarn dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## That's it

I developed it for personal use just to simplify this calculation/division job at bars and restaurants checking, but feel free to fork it and make your own custom needs. I hope you enjoy it too, let's have fun!
